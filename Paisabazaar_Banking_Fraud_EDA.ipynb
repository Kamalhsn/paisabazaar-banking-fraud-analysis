        "Paisabazaar is a financial services company that assists customers in finding and applying for various banking and credit products. An integral part of their service is assessing the creditworthiness of individuals, which is crucial for both loan approval and risk management. The credit score of a person is a significant metric used by financial institutions to determine the likelihood that an individual will repay their loans or credit balances. Accurate classification of credit scores can help Paisabazaar enhance their credit assessment processes, reduce the risk of loan defaults, and offer personalized financial advice to their customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this context, analyzing and classifying credit scores based on customer data can improve decision-making processes and contribute to better financial product recommendations. This case study aims to develop a model that predicts the credit score of individuals based on various features, such as income, credit card usage, and payment behavior."

Sudden changes or high values in these indicators, especially for customers with a 'Poor' Credit Mix, could signal increased risk or potential fraudulent behavior, allowing for proactive intervention.\n",
        "\n",

Educating customers on managing debt (Outstanding_Debt), improving their Credit_Mix, and making timely payments (Delay_from_due_date, Payment_of_Min_Amount) can reduce risk and build trust.\n",

        "Red Flags for Delayed Payments and High Debt: We found that customers who often pay late or have a lot of debt almost always have 'poor' credit scores. These are crucial warning signs.\n",
        "How You Pay Counts: Just paying the minimum amount usually means a weaker credit score. Paying more, or on time, builds strong credit.\n",

        "(What we did to prepare the data)\n",

To ensure consistency and facilitate future encoding, these 'NM' values were replaced with the most frequent value (mode) in the column, which was 'No'. This makes the column binary ('Yes'/'No') for easier processing.\n",

These were converted to `int64` to reflect their true nature and potentially save memory.\n",

It was label-encoded into a numerical format: 'Poor' as 0, 'Standard' as 1, and 'Good' as 2. This ordinal encoding reflects the inherent order of creditworthiness and makes the column suitable for machine learning models.\n",

This new feature provides a quantitative measure of a customer's loan portfolio diversity, which could be a significant indicator for credit risk.\n",

        "    *   Several columns that serve as unique identifiers or redundant information were dropped:\n",
        "        *   'ID', 'Customer_ID', 'Name', 'SSN': These are unique identifiers that typically do not hold predictive power for credit scoring and can introduce noise or raise privacy concerns. 'SSN' was also a float, which is unusual for a Social Security Number, suggesting it might be anonymized but still not useful as a direct feature.\n",
        "        *   'Type_of_Loan': This column was dropped after the 'Num_of_Loan_Types' feature was successfully extracted, as the original string format is less directly usable for modeling, and its information is now captured in the new numerical feature.\n",

However, the presence of 'NM' in 'Payment_of_Min_Amount' highlighted a categorical inconsistency that required careful handling. By replacing it with the mode, we maintained data integrity and consistency.\n",
        "*   **Feature Utility**: Creating 'Num_of_Loan_Types' transforms a complex, multi-valued string feature into a quantifiable one. This new feature can potentially reveal patterns related to financial diversity or risk appetite. For instance, a higher number of diverse loan types might indicate either a more complex financial profile or higher credit utilization/risk, which can be further explored in subsequent analysis.\n",
        "*   **Preparation for Modeling**: The encoding of 'Credit_Score' and the conversion of several `float` columns to `int` types bring the dataset significantly closer to a format ready for machine learning algorithms. Most models perform optimally with numerical inputs. The removal of identifier and redundant columns also helps reduce dimensionality, potential noise, and the risk of overfitting, leading to a more focused and efficient dataset for analysis and prediction."
